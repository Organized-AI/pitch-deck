## Quick Setup Instructions:

1. **Save the 5 hackathon photos** to the `images/` folder with these exact names:

   - `collaboration.jpg` - Three people collaborating around laptop
   - `focused-learning.jpg` - Person in focused learning environment
   - `networking.jpg` - Two people with Antler branding

## File Requirements:
