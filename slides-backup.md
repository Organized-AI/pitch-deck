# The Revolution is Here
## But Most People Are Missing It

<v-clicks>

- **Traditional coding bootcamps**: 12-24 months, $15k+ investment
- **University CS degrees**: 4 years, massive debt
- **Self-taught developers**: Years of struggle, high failure rate

<br>

### Meanwhile, AI tools are democratizing development
*But there's no clear path to leverage them professionally*

# The Problem

<v-clicks>

- **Overwhelming AI Tool Landscape**
  - Hundreds of coding assistants
  - No clear learning path
  - Most tutorials are surface-level

- **Skills Gap**
  - Can build demos, but not production apps
  - Missing engineering best practices
  - No bridge to real-world systems

- **Isolation**
  - Learning alone is hard
  - No community of like-minded learners
  - No mentorship or guidance

</v-clicks>

# The Opportunity

<v-clicks>

- **$1.3T Software Market**
  - Growing 8.6% annually
  - Massive developer shortage
  - AI amplifies individual capability

- **Speed to Market**
  - Traditional paths too slow
  - Market moving faster than education
  - First-mover advantage available

- **Democratization**
  - Geographic barriers removed
  - Age barriers removed
  - Background barriers removed
